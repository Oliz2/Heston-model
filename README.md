# Heston Model Project (Work in Progress)

This repository contains a Maven/Eclipse project template for studying the Heston model, including model calibration, variance swaps, and delta hedging exercises. 

**Current status:** Only Exercise 1 (model risk and recalibration) has been completed. The remaining exercises (Variance Swap replication and Delta Hedging) are still in progress.  

The project uses the Finmath library for model implementation and market data handling, and includes scripts for generating time series of calibrated parameters and analyzing their stability. More features and exercises will be added as the project progresses.
